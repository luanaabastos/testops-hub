# TestOps Hub

**From CI test execution to actionable quality insights.**

TestOps Hub is a portfolio TestOps platform that collects automated test reports from CI pipelines and turns them into centralized execution history, quality metrics and regression insights.

**Live Demo:** [qualityops-hub.onrender.com](https://qualityops-hub.onrender.com)<br>
**Architecture:** React + Fastify on Render, PostgreSQL on Neon, browser automation in GitHub Actions<br>
**CI Status:** [![Platform CI](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/workflows/platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/workflows/platform.yml)

[`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/releases/tag/v1.0.0) · [MIT](LICENSE) · Node.js `20.20.1` · pnpm `10.34.5`

> Every product, user, test, execution and metric in this project is fictional and synthetic. The linked CI workflows, browser runs, reports, ingestion and persistence are real portfolio evidence.

## What problem does it solve?

Automated-test evidence is often split across:

- GitHub Actions jobs;
- report artifacts;
- framework-specific output;
- logs;
- older executions.

Instead of checking multiple pipelines and reports manually, TestOps Hub provides one consolidated view of test quality. It makes it easier to answer what ran, what failed, whether a regression is new and where the evidence came from.

## How it works

History + Metrics + Regression Signals
```

GitHub Actions runs Cypress and Playwright in real browsers and retains their reports as artifacts. An authenticated Fastify API validates each report, selects a versioned adapter and stores one normalized execution in Neon PostgreSQL. The React dashboard then presents history, metrics and Regression Delta.

## Real CI Evidence

These workflows are public proof. Each one ran real browser automation, preserved its framework report and ingested the result into the hosted API.

| Scenario | Framework | Executed | Passed | Failed | Workflow | Artifact | Dashboard execution |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| ShopSphere — success | Cypress / Mochawesome | 5 | 5 | 0 | [Run 32431118788](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/runs/32431118788) | [Mochawesome report](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/runs/32431118788/artifacts/9429101193) | [Execution](https://qualityops-hub.onrender.com/executions/a8a65b5d-17b2-4714-b3c1-d2192b945963) |
| ServiceDesk — success | Playwright / JSON | 5 | 5 | 0 | [Run 32431321053](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/runs/32431321053) | [Playwright report](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/runs/32431321053/artifacts/9429173727) | [Execution](https://qualityops-hub.onrender.com/executions/6899dec4-d7d6-4fe9-ba89-7edf30b88d1c) |
| ShopSphere — functional failure | Cypress / Mochawesome | 5 | 4 | 1 | [Expected failed run 32431559619](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/runs/32431559619) | [Mochawesome report](https://github.com/luanaabastos/testops-hub/actions/runs/32431559619/artifacts/9429251422) | [Execution](https://qualityops-hub.onrender.com/executions/af12fdee-6860-4916-a35c-9fce60022556) |

The functional-failure workflow finishes red only after its report is uploaded and ingested. The official dashboard aggregate is **10 executed, 9 passed, 1 failed, 0 infrastructure errors, 90% Approval Rate and a 90% Quality Score**.

## Demo vs Official Evidence

| Label | Meaning | Affects official metrics? |
|---|---|---|
| **Official CI** | Real Cypress or Playwright browser tests executed by GitHub Actions and ingested into the platform. | Yes |
| **Hosted Preview** | A safe hosted demonstration of the ingestion stages. It starts no browser and creates no execution. | No |
| **Demo Data** | Synthetic history and planning data used only to explain parts of the interface. | No |
| **Local Demo** | Allow-listed local runners used during development and validation. | No |

PocketWallet is explicitly a deterministic **Mobile Harness Demo**, not a real Android or Appium run.

```

Browser automation stays in GitHub Actions because the hosted free tier serves the application and API rather than browser-heavy workers. The dashboard and API share the same Render origin.

## Features

- Normalization for Mochawesome, Playwright JSON and `mobile-e2e-json-v1` reports.
- Product-scoped authenticated ingestion.
- Idempotent replay and HTTP 409 for conflicting content at the same identity.
- Traceable execution history with workflow, job, artifact, branch and commit metadata.
- Approval Rate, Quality Score, freshness and explicit infrastructure-error semantics.
- Regression Delta for new, recovered, persistent, added and removed tests.
- **Automation Coverage** for mapped quality scenarios; it is not code coverage.
- Execution Details with sanitized diagnostics.
- Pipeline Lab with allow-listed local runners and a separate Hosted Preview mode.
- Health and readiness endpoints.
- Responsive, keyboard-accessible portfolio UI.

## Engineering Decisions

- **Versioned adapters:** framework parsing stays separate from HTTP routes and domain metrics.
- **Normalized execution model:** different report formats remain comparable without losing traceability.
- **Product-scoped tokens:** each integration is restricted to its own fictional product.
- **Idempotency:** CI retries return the original execution; conflicting content is rejected.
- **External CI for browsers:** GitHub Actions runs real Cypress and Playwright while Render hosts the UI and API.
- **Preview is not evidence:** Hosted Preview demonstrates state transitions but cannot change official metrics.
- **Stable internal names:** package scopes, environment variables, database names and the hosted URL retain `qualityops` identifiers to avoid an unrelated migration during the public product and repository rename.

## Limitations

- PocketWallet is a deterministic Mobile Harness Demo, not a real device run.
- Render Free may introduce a cold start.
- Object storage is not enabled; GitHub Actions retains external-CI reports.
- There is no user authentication, role model or multi-tenancy.
- Background demo jobs use an in-process queue without distributed recovery.
- Video Evidence is a clearly labeled concept preview without stored recordings.
- The hosted URL and stable internal identifiers still use `qualityops-hub`; they do not change the public TestOps Hub product or repository identity.

## Live Demo

[https://qualityops-hub.onrender.com](https://qualityops-hub.onrender.com)

- All products and displayed data are fictional.
- Real Cypress and Playwright evidence comes from the linked GitHub Actions workflows.
- Neon PostgreSQL persists normalized execution history.
- Hosted Preview does not run browsers or create official evidence.
- Render Free may need a cold start before the first response.

## Security

- Raw integration tokens are shown once; PostgreSQL stores salted scrypt hashes.
- Report bodies are bounded and schema-validated; SQL calls are parameterized and ingestion is transactional.
- Pipeline Lab accepts mapped enums and never builds arbitrary commands or paths.
- Diagnostics are sanitized before persistence.
- Public-release scans cover corporate references, secrets, history, paths, assets and Git identities.
